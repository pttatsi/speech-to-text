# speech-to-text
Demo

My most prominent thought about what we have done with these files is good job. If I was solely relying on this for text from video say for a lecture that I don't want to watch but need the information, this is great. I like that it gives timestamps that I can cross-reference with the actual video if I was feeling a bit lied to by it. I am not really sure what else could be done with this setup, mainly because I am not super familiar with code, but I can see its usefulness from the one task I have used it for. I like that it can give you the text in many different formats that can be helpful for different occassions or visual styles.
